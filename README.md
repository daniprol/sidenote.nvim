# sidenote.nvim

> "The way that you remember things is by trying to remember them."

In a compelling video on how to remember everything you read, [Professor Jeffrey Kaplan explains an effective technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiNB-6SuqVA): after reading a passage, force yourself to summarize its core idea in a single sentence in the margin. This act of retrieval is what builds long-term memory.

`sidenote.nvim` is a Neovim plugin designed to bring this powerful learning method directly into your text editor. It allows you to attach your thoughts, summaries, and questions to text as non-intrusive "margin notes," which are displayed as virtual text or signs.

It's a simple tool for a profound purpose: to help you think more deeply and remember more effectively.

## Configuration

You can override any of the default settings by passing a table to the `setup()` function.

Here is the default configuration:

```lua
require('sidenote').setup({
  -- A list of filetypes for which the plugin should be active.
  filetypes = { 'markdown', 'txt' },

  -- The plugin is enabled by default. Use :SidenoteToggle to change.
  enabled = true,

  -- The maximum number of characters allowed in a note.
  max_char_count = 150,

  keymap = {
    create_note = '<leader>sn',
    delete_note = '<leader>sx',
    edit_note = '<leader>se',
    list_notes = '<leader>sl',
  },

  -- The name of the directory where all notes are stored.
  notes_dir_name = '.sidenotes',

  -- The file extension for individual note files.
  note_file_extension = '.sn',

  -- UI Display configuration
  ui = {
    -- Display method: 'virtual_text', 'signs', or 'both'
    method = 'virtual_text',

    virtual_text = {
      -- Position: 'eol', 'right_align', 'overlay', 'inline'
      position = 'eol',
      -- Prefix for virtual text
      prefix = 'üìù',
      -- Maximum length of displayed note text
      max_length = 50,
    },

    signs = {
      -- Emoji for sign column
      emoji = 'üìù',
      -- Sign priority
      priority = 10,
    }
  },
})
```
